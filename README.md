## Kaggle Strategies and skills

**Data preparation**

After data exploration, the first thing to do is to use those insights to prepare the data. To tackle issues like class imbalance, encoding categorical data, etc. Let’s see the methods used to do it.

- [Methods to tackle class imbalance](https://www.kaggle.com/shahules/tackling-class-imbalance).
- Data augmentation by **[Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique](https://machinelearningmastery.com/smote-oversampling-for-imbalanced-classification/)**.
- Fast inplace **[shuffle for augmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/jiweiliu/fast-inplace-shuffle-for-augmentation)**.
- Finding [synthetic samples in the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yag320/list-of-fake-samples-and-public-private-lb-split).
- [Signal denoising](https://www.kaggle.com/jackvial/dwt-signal-denoising) used in signal processing competitions.
- Finding [patterns of missing data](https://www.kaggle.com/jpmiller/patterns-of-missing-data).
- Methods to handle [missing data](https://towardsdatascience.com/6-different-ways-to-compensate-for-missing-values-data-imputation-with-examples-6022d9ca0779).
- An overview of various [encoding techniques for categorical data](https://www.kaggle.com/shahules/an-overview-of-encoding-techniques).
- Building [model to predict missing values](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/discussion/64598).
- Random [shuffling of data](https://www.kaggle.com/brandenkmurray/randomly-shuffled-data-also-works) to create new synthetic training set.

**Dealing with larger datasets**

One issue you might face in any machine learning competition is the size of your data set. If the size of your data is large, that is 3GB + for kaggle kernels and more basic laptops you could find it difficult to load and process with limited resources. Here is the link to some of the articles and kernels that may be very useful in such situations.

- Faster [data loading with pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/discussion/59575).
- Data compression techniques to [reduce the size of data by 70%](https://www.kaggle.com/nickycan/compress-70-of-dataset).
- Optimize the memory by [reducing the size of some attributes](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/large-data-loading-trick-with-ms-malware-data).
- Use open-source libraries such as [Dask to read and manipulate the data](https://www.kaggle.com/yuliagm/how-to-work-with-big-datasets-on-16g-ram-dask), it performs parallel computing and saves up memory space.
- Use [cudf](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf).
- Convert data to [parquet](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/parquet.html) format.
- Converting data to [feather](https://medium.com/@snehotosh.banerjee/feather-a-fast-on-disk-format-for-r-and-python-data-frames-de33d0516b03) format.
- Reducing memory usage for [optimizing RAM](https://www.kaggle.com/mjbahmani/reducing-memory-size-for-ieee).

**Data exploration**

Data exploration always helps to better understand the data and gain insights from it. Before starting to develop machine learning models, top competitors always read/do a lot of exploratory data analysis for the data. This helps in feature engineering and cleaning of the data.

- EDA for microsoft [malware detection](https://www.kaggle.com/youhanlee/my-eda-i-want-to-see-all).
- Time Series [EDA for malware detection](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/time-split-validation-malware-0-68).
- Complete [EDA for home credit loan prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/codename007/home-credit-complete-eda-feature-importance).

**Feature selection**

After generating many features from your data, you need to decide which all features to use in your model to get the maximum performance out of your model. This step also includes identifying the impact each feature is having on your model. Let’s see some of the most popular feature selection methods.

**Modeling**

After handcrafting and selecting your features, you should choose the right Machine learning algorithm to make your prediction. These are the collection of some of the most used ML models in structured data classification challenges.
